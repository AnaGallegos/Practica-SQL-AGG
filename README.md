## Objectives
In KeepCoding we want to manage the fleet of company vehicles, controlling the models of the cars, the brands and the business group of the brand (for example VW SEAT, Audi etc. belong to the VAN group)
Of the cars we also need to know the color of the car, its license plate, the total number of kilometers it has, the insurance company (Mapfre, MMT, AXA etc), the number of
policy, date of purchase etc.
In addition, we want to control the revisions of each car that have been carried out on the car, knowing the Kms it had at the time of the revision, the date of the revision and the amount of the revision.


Design a normalized ER model for a car rental company
Load the data into the tables
Create a SQL query that, for each car, gives us:
it's model, brand and the company that owns said brand
it's purchase date
it's license plate
it's color
it's mileage
it's insurance number
the name of the insurance company where the car is insured
